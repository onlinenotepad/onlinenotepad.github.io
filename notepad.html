				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>
					Online Notepad is a free browser-based text editor that allows you to create and edit multiple plain-text files in your browser.
					No registration and login required. It is great for writing quick notes and printing a simple page. What makes it special is the
					autosave functionality which saves your draft every second. This prevents data loss in case you accidentally close the tab, or the
					browser window suddenly crashes. The document you're working on will be automatically restored when you visit back, even when you
					close and reopen your browser. There's also support for saving documents directly to your computer. Online Notepad is packed with
					core features that your common text editor provides, including undo, redo, copy, cut, paste, find and replace, font formatting,
					character map, insert date and time, emoji list, spell checker, word counter, open and save files, and print page.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p>
					Changes are saved automatically as you work thanks to HTML5 localStorage API. It grabs a copy of the content from the text editor
					and saves it to your computer. With this method, your data never leaves your device. The default time interval at which drafts are
					saved is 1000ms or 1 second. Your notes will stay in the web browser until you clear the cookies and other site data. You can try
					it out by typing anything in the editor and refreshing the page.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>
				<p>
					Online Notepad supports modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge, Internet Explorer and
					Steam browser. You need to enable JavaScript in order to use the app.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>
					This web app is a free product, which can be used by any individual, company, school, government office etc. I originally made
					this for myself to help me remember ideas that will eventually end up on my personal blog. This simple tool that all started as a
					simple project has helped my productivity immensely and I hope it helps you too.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>Features in Detail</h3>
				<p>Our online notepad comes with several powerful features that make it a versatile tool for your writing needs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Rich Text Formatting:</strong> Although primarily a plain-text editor, you can format your text with basic styling
						options like bold, italic, and underline when needed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong> Increase your productivity with common keyboard shortcuts for operations like copy
						(Ctrl+C), paste (Ctrl+V), undo (Ctrl+Z), and more.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mobile Friendly:</strong> The editor is fully responsive and works seamlessly across all devices, from smartphones to
						desktop computers.
					</li>
					<li><strong>No Sign-up Required:</strong> Start writing immediately without any registration process or login requirements.</li>
				</ul>

				<hr />
				<h3>Tips for Using Online Notepad</h3>
				<p>To get the most out of your Online Notepad experience:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use the 'Save As' feature regularly to backup important notes to your computer</li>
					<li>Take advantage of the find and replace feature for quick text editing</li>
					<li>Use the word counter to track your writing progress</li>
					<li>Remember that your notes persist between sessions unless you clear your browser data</li>
				</ul>

				<hr />
				<h3>Privacy & Security</h3>
				<p>
					We take your privacy seriously. Since all data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage, your notes remain private and
					secure. No data is transmitted to or stored on our servers. This makes it perfect for sensitive information, though we recommend
					backing up important notes to your local device.
